Python Quickstart
=================

.. note::
   This section describes the Python Playground, not the Python SDK. The documentation on that is :ref:`here <sdk>`.

The main section of the dashboard provides a `Gradio Lite <https://www.gradio.app/guides/gradio-lite>`_ development environment, running entirely in your browser, with access to your database, preloaded with some sample code.

.. caution::
   Your modifications are not saved between reloads! This playground is meant for prototyping -- consider using the :doc:`sdk` for larger projects.
