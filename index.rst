Welcome to the Pacuare Reserve developer documentation! Log into the dashboard `here <https://app.pacuare.dev>`_.

This documentation is meant to help you get started with the Pacuare `data platform <https://app.pacuare.dev>`_. We recommend starting with the :doc:`SQL quickstart <sql>`, as it goes over some background information about the database and data structure. After that, feel free to get started experimenting with :doc:`Python <python>` or dive right into the :doc:`api`.
